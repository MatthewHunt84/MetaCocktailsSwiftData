let kinaLilletExplanation = "The original cocktail called for Kina Lillet which is a quinine bitter that stopped production in 1985. The closest thing we can find to it is Cocchi Americano, so that's why we're using it here. Lillet Blanc is nothing like Kina Lillet."

// General Info

let tiPunchNotesWnG = "Think of this like an Old Fashioned without the bitters."

let caipirnhaNotes = "Caipirinha is the national drink of Brazil. Cachaça is a native Brazilian spirit distilled from juiced sugarcane."

// Recipe Note Info
let ramosNotes = "This is the recipe used at Williams and Graham. It's slightly modified from the original."

let oldFashionedBuild = "This is a more modern version that you'll find at upscale cocktail bars. This is also our prefered version of the Old Fashioned. Making a rich dem adds texture to the cocktail and also has the added benefit of fully emulsifying. A sugar cube does not."

let smokingMonkeyNotes = "The original cocktail had a rice paper cut-out of a smoking monkey where the bitters were the smoke design."

// History Info

let armyNavyNotes = "Like many classics, the author of the Army & Navy is unknown. David Embury's early publication of the recipe in 1948 is excellent, even by modern standards."

var laLouisianeNotes  = "The A La Louisiane (sometimes called De La Louisiane) is the former house drink of historic New Orleans’ restaurant La Louisiane, which was built in 1881."

let cloverClubNotes = "The original Clover Club was a gentleman's club in Philadelphia from 1882-1920s, where the cocktail originated. Julie Reiner's recipe is a great example of a modern sour which stays true the the original formula, shaken with dry vermouth."

let harveyWalbangerNotes = "This is a built cocktail that gained popularity through a marketing campaign from George Bednar for McKesson Imports (Galliano's importer at the time). Though, the drink itself was likely the creation of bartender Donato 'Duke' Antone, who may have been serving it since the 1950s at the Hollywood bar Black Watch, calling it the 'Duke Screwdriver'. Bednar picked it up in the late 60s and built an advertising campaign around it for McKesson. It goes to show you that even if the cocktail is total trash, as long as its easy-to-make and there's tons of advertising behind it, it has a chance to make it into the history books and people like us, who dedicate their entire careers to perfecting their craft, end up writing about it."

let saturnNotes = "California bartender  J. “Popo” Galsini introduced the Saturn to the world in 1967 when he won the International Bartender’s Association World Championship with it. Originally he titled his gin creation the X-15 after an American rocket plane, but shortly after doing so one of those planes crashed, killing its pilot. Reportedly, Galsini renamed the drink as the Saturn for the competition."

let aperolSpritzNotes = "Aperol was introduced to the market in 1919, initially enjoyed primarily with soda water. Around the mid-20th century, this bitter liqueur found its way into the classic Italian spritz, enhancing the popular drink with the addition of sparkling wine. A significant turning point came in 2003 when the Campari company acquired Aperol. They launched a highly effective advertising campaign that dramatically increased the drink's global popularity. As a result of this marketing success, the Aperol Spritz has become a universally recognized cocktail."

let carajilloNotes = "Licor 43, a sweet vanilla-based Spanish liqueur, was first produced by the Zamora family in 1946. Its natural affinity with espresso led to a popular cocktail combination. When shaken with ice, this mixture creates a foamy texture, with the coffee's bitterness balancing the liqueur's sweetness. The drink's origins are unclear, but it likely emerged from Spain. This cocktail is a great example of how technique is everything."

let cosmoNotes = "While this cocktail originated in the 1980s, its popularity surged in the early 2000s during the cocktail renaissance, thanks in large part to Dale DeGroff's influence at New York's Rainbow Room. The HBO series 'Sex and the City' also played a substantial role in boosting its fame. Regardless of its origins, it's undeniable that this drink has firmly established itself in the pantheon of modern cocktails."

let cornNOilNotes = "The Corn 'n' Oil cocktail likely originated in Barbados during the 18th century. Its intriguing name is derived from a biblical passage in Deuteronomy, which refers to gathering \"corn, wine, and oil\" Like other cocktails with such a long history, it fails to produce a notable author."

let elDiabloNotes = "The original 'Diablo' cocktail first appeared in the 1940 book 'The How and When' by Hayman Gale and Gerald F. Marco. Initially, it was a rum-based drink. Trader Vic later modified the recipe, substituting tequila for rum, and dubbed it 'Mexican El Diablo'. Eventually, he shortened the name to simply 'El Diablo'."

let hemingwayNote = "The original cocktail stemmed from the Daiquiri No. 3 at La Floridita, which actually was one of the first blended Daiquiris to ever exist as Constantino 'Constante' Ribalaigua was utilizing the latest technology that existed at the time, the blender. Hemingway loved the cocktail but asked for it with no sugar and double the rum making it an insanely tart and punchy cocktail. The cocktail is unbalanced but I think it's important to understand where this cocktail came from and why it exists."

let palomaNotes = "The pairing of grapefruit soda and tequila undoubtedly originated in Mexico. This drink existed with several different titles depending on the region. According to cocktail historian Dave Wondrich, the name 'Paloma' (Spanish for 'dove') wasn't associated with this drink until the 1990s in California. After this introduction to the cocktail lexicon, the drink quickly gained widespread popularity."

let pimsCupNotes = "The Pimm's Cup originated around 1912 as a bottled sling called \"Pimm's No. 1 Cup\". It was similar to today's ready-to-drink cocktails, but without carbonation or citrus. Pimm's itself is now known as a liqueur resembling an amaro. Today, the Pimm's Cup is the official drink of Wimbledon. Modern versions of this cocktail are restorative and refreshing, evolving significantly from the original formula. Contemporary recipes like this one offer a more refined drinking experience, compared to the original bottled version."

let piscoSourNotes = "Both Peru and Chile claim the Pisco Sour as their national cocktail. The cocktail's earliest mention at Morris' bar in Peru didn't include egg whites or bitters. Similarly, early Chilean variations also lacked these ingredients. The cocktail began to make appearances in the United States in the 1960s, however it wasn't until the cocktail renaissance of the early 2000s that it gained its reputation as a classic sour, shaken with egg whites."

let rustyNailNotes = "According to cocktail historian Dave Wondrich, the name 'Rusty Nail' wasn't documented until 1961. However, the combination of Drambuie and Scotch likely dates back to 1908 when Drambuie began production. Given Wondrich's reputation as a leading authority on cocktail history, his research on this topic is considered highly reliable. The absence of a specific creator attribution for the Rusty Nail reflects the drink's unclear origins and the general consensus among experts about its history."

let singSlingNotes = "There's a ton of controversy with the original recipe here. So we're using what the Raffles hotel claims to be the original recipe."

let stingerBuild = "The combination of brandy and creme de menthe has been seen popping up in New York since the late 1880s. The 'Stinger' name wasn't attached to it until the early 1910s. Is it technically a cocktail? Maybe it isn't. But we think it's at least worth a mention."

let tomCollinsNotes = "The Tom Collins started out as the John Collins in the early 1800s. The name change came in part from a common prank that local American bar flies would play on out-of-towners, saying that someone named \"Tom Collins\" was badmouthing them at the bar next door. The solid 1800s prank, combined with the fact that the drink was usually made with Old Tom Gin, lead to the name we know today."

let vesperNotes = "The cocktail was not Fleming's creation. It was devised by his friend Ivar Bryce as evidenced by the words Fleming inscribed in Bryce's copy of Casino Royale: 'For Ivar, who mixed the first Vesper and said the good word.' Naming a cocktail the Vesper was Fleming's idea though he drew inspiration from someone else's joke. He had encountered the term at evening drinks when a butler announced: 'Vespers are served.' Fleming adapted this pun on the name of the religious observance normally held about sunset, 'Vespers'. And Bond alludes to this by praising his cocktail's name as 'very appropriate to the violet hour when my cocktail will now be drunk all over the world.' Just as the character Vesper Lynd dies in Casino Royale, the cocktail named for her makes no appearance in any of Fleming's later Bond novels. Fleming, in a letter to The Guardian in 1958, said that when he tasted a Vesper for the first time several months after including it in his novel, he found it 'unpalatable'."

let whiskeySmashNotes = "Rather than a single drink, the \"Smash\" was initially a category of cocktails documented by Jerry Thomas' influential 1862 book \"How to Mix Drinks, or The Bon Vivant's Companion\". In its original form, a Smash typically included sugar, spirit, mint, and ice. This modern version builds upon that classic foundation by incorporating whiskey and fresh lemon juice, a modification that gained popularity during the cocktail renaissance of the early 2000s. Renowned bartenders like Dale DeGroff, often credited as a key figure in reviving interest in classic cocktails, played a significant role in popularizing this updated take on the Smash."

let sherryCobblerNotes = "This cocktail is one of those 'too old to tell' cocktails, so it's up to interpretation."

// History info mixed with and recipe info

let amarettoSourNotes = "The Amaretto Sour was first introduced to the public in 1974 by the importer of Amaretto di Saronno. The original recipe called for a ratio of 1.5 oz (45 ml) of Amaretto to 3 oz (90 ml) of sour mix, without the inclusion of egg whites or bitters. This formulation tends to produce a notably sweet cocktail. However, we believe the natural sweetness of the liqueur itself is sufficient to balance the drink. Our approach is to use 1 oz of fresh lemon juice to complement the sweetness of Amaretto, especially when incorporating egg whites. For those who prefer to omit the egg whites, we recommend to reduce the lemon juice to 0.75 oz and adjust the sweetness to taste. A good starting point is to add 0.25 oz of simple syrup, increasing or decreasing as needed to achieve the desired balance."

let bizzyIzzyNotes = "This is an interesting cocktail that seems to have a number of variations. The book with the original print calls for a pineapple syrup but the modern variation adds up to an ounce of pineapple juice."

let bloodyMaryNotes = "The origins of this cocktail are shrouded in mystery, with several unverified stories claiming its creation. We present here a simple, classic version of the recipe. Feel free to embellish or modify it to suit your own tastes."

var brooklynNotes = "The Brooklyn Cocktail was essentially a Manhattan variation, combining equal parts rye and Italian vermouth with dashes of Maraschino and Amer Picon (originally stronger and more bitter than today's version). The modern dry vermouth version likely arose from Jacques Straub's 1914 Drinks manual, where he apparently mistook Ballor, an Italian sweet vermouth, for French dry vermouth."

let margNotes = "The term 'Margarita' translates to 'daisy' in Spanish. In cocktail parlance, a daisy refers to a classic drink style akin to a sour, with liqueur standing in for a sugar syrup. Margaritas typically have a tart flavor profile. For those who prefer a more balanced taste, consider adding 0.25 oz of simple syrup or agave nectar to suit your palate. The Margarita's origins are disputed, with numerous individuals claiming to have invented it, making it difficult to attribute its creation to any single person."

let mintJulepNotes = "This is one of the oldest cocktails to exist. This is a style of cocktail that came from a long rich history of the 'Julep' dating back to the early 1700s. This whiskey version didn't come to prominence until the mid 1800s. The Kentucky Derby didn't claim it until the 1930's. That being said, this cocktail is almost impossible to credit one person or place for its invention. The version we're presenting here is a more modernized take. So, feel free to modify the sugar content to your liking."

let mojitoNotes = "This is a more modern version of the mojito that you'll find in cocktail bars all across America. Original recipes seem to all leave the mint in the glass and treat it more as a built cocktail. The cocktail definitely stems from Cuba in the 1800s, and was popularized at bars like La Floridita. Though, like many cocktails from this era, there isn't simply one name to attach to its creation."

var daiquiriNotes = "This is the king of the Cuban cocktails. While the preferred balance of citrus and and sweet varies between bartenders, a high quality white rum is essential. We recommend Planteray 3 star or Banks 5 Island."

var darkAndStormyNotes = " \"The drink might have been invented by British sailors on shore leave in Bermuda after World War I. Though, in 1991, the Gosling family, which founded Gosling's in Bermuda in 1806, claimed a trademark for the recipe...\" -David Wondrich, The Oxford Companion to Spirits and Cocktails"

let pinaColadaNotes = "The widely recognized version of the Piña Colada today is a blended frozen cocktail that originated with the creation of Coco Lopez in Puerto Rico. It is regarded as their signature drink. The term 'Piña Colada' translates to 'strained pineapple.' According to Dave Wondrich, prior to Coco Lopez, the Piña Colada was a Cuban non-alcoholic refreshment. It's likely that Cubans also mixed rum into it, representing one of those seemingly inevitable combinations that obscure its true origin. To prepare this version, you'll need approximately 250ml of crushed ice to blend with the other ingredients."

let robRoyNotes = "The Manhattan, Rob Roy, and Emerald cocktails all emerged in the late 19th century, with the Manhattan serving as the inspiration for the other two. The Manhattan led to the creation of the Rob Roy, substituting Scotch whisky in place of American whiskey. The Emerald meanwhile features Irish whiskey instead."

let sazeracNotes = "This is a modernization of the original cocktail, which had a base of Cognac in place of Rye. This is also our prefered version of the Sazerac. Making a rich dem adds texture to the cocktail and also has the added benefit of fully emulsifying. A sugar cube does not."

let ward8Notes = "There's a lot of speculation as to where this cocktail comes from. Here, we're using the oldest version that we could find that seems to be in line with how modern bartenders are presenting it."

let whiskeySourNotes = "The term 'Whiskey Sour' first appeared in print as early as 1826. Like the Old Fashioned, this classic cocktail has been a longstanding fixture in the world of mixology. Its origins are disputed, with numerous individuals claiming to have invented it over the years. While egg whites have always been an optional ingredient in the Whiskey Sour, their inclusion is recommended."

var martiniNotes = "The Martini - which predates the Manhattan - has evolved significantly over time. The original recipe featured more vermouth than gin, later shifting to equal parts, then progressively less vermouth. By the 1910s, vodka began replacing gin in some versions. By the 1950s, without the botanical profile of gin to accompany it, vermouth lost popularity with olive brine often taking its place. While this is an excellent recipe for a classic Martini, the most important recipe for a Martini is the one the drinker asks you for."

let prizeFighterNotes = "Simply named 'Prizefighter' when it debuted on the menu at Julie Reiner's Clover Club in Manhattan, the 'Prizefighter No. 1' designation was appended only after subsequent iterations of the drink found their way onto the menu."

let gibsonNotes = "\"The name of the cocktail came from illustrator Charles Dana Gibson, the creator of the Gibson Girl drawings, or Walder D.K. Gibson. Both were members of the club.\"\n - Dave Wondrich, The Oxford Companion to Spirits and Cocktails"

let peguClubSavoyNotes = "The favorite cocktail at the Pegu Club, Burma. The one that has travelled, and is asked for, around the world.\" -Harry Craddock"
