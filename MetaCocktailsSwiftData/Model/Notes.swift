let kinaLilletExplanation = "The original cocktail called for Kina Lillet, a quinine bitter that stopped production in 1985. The closest modern equivalent is Cocchi Americano. Note that Lillet Blanc is notably different from the original Kina Lillet."

// General Info

let tiPunchNoteWnG = "Think of this like an Old Fashioned without the bitters."

let caipirnhaNote = "Caipirinha is the national drink of Brazil. Cachaça is a native Brazilian spirit distilled from juiced sugarcane."

// Recipe Note Info
let ramosNote = "This is the recipe used at Williams and Graham, slightly modified from the original."

let oldFashionedNote = "This modern version is commonly found at upscale cocktail bars and is our preferred interpretation. Using rich demerara syrup adds texture and ensures full emulsification, which a sugar cube cannot achieve."

let smokingMonkeyNote = "The original cocktail featured a rice paper cut-out of a smoking monkey, with bitters used to create the smoke design."

// History Info
let morningGloryFizzNote = "'To be drunk immediately, or the effect will be lost. It is a morning beverage, a tonic and a nerve quieter.' -O.H. Byron"

let armyNavyNote = "Like many classics, the Army & Navy's creator remains unknown. David Embury's 1948 publication of the recipe remains excellent by modern standards."

var bobbyBurnsNote = "Featuring equal parts Scotch whisky and sweet vermouth, this classic Rob Roy variation from Hugo Ensslin calls for Bénédictine in place of aromatic bitters. The modification creates a sweeter profile, so we'd recommend a more bitter vermouth such as Punt e Mes or Carpano Antica over Dolin Rouge"

let laLouisianeNote  = "The À la Louisiane (sometimes called De la Louisiane) was the house drink of La Louisiane, the historic New Orleans restaurant established in 1881."

let cloverClubNote = "The Clover Club cocktail originated at its namesake, a gentleman's club in Philadelphia (1882-1920s). Julie Reiner's recipe exemplifies a modern sour that remains faithful to the original formula, incorporating dry vermouth."

let harveyWalbangerNote = "Proof that a good marketing campaign can make any cocktail famous. While bartender Donato 'Duke' Antone likely created this drink in the 1950s at Hollywood's Black Watch bar (calling it the 'Duke Screwdriver'), it was George Bednar's brilliant marketing for McKesson Imports that made it a hit. Who knew that slapping some Galliano in a screwdriver and giving it a catchy name would end up in cocktail history books? Sadly enough, sometimes simplicity and advertising trump craft."

let ginAndItNote =  "'It' is short for Italian vermouth, and the original recipe from the 1905 'Hoffman House Bartender's Guide: How to Open a Saloon and Make it Pay' calls for 2.5oz gin and .5oz sweet Italian vermouth. But, Sasha and I only ever drank it with a 2:1 gin-to-vermouth ratio. -Georgette Moger-Petraske"

let saturnNote = "California bartender J. 'Popo' Galsini introduced the Saturn to the world in 1967 when he won the International Bartenders' Association World Championship. Originally, he titled his gin creation the X-15 after an American rocket plane. Shortly after doing so one of those planes crashed, killing its pilot. Galsini renamed the drink as the Saturn for the competition."

let aperolSpritzNote = "Aperol debuted in 1919, first mixed simply with soda water. By the mid-20th century, it had evolved into the classic Italian spritz with the addition of sparkling wine. The drink's global fame exploded after Campari's acquisition of Aperol in 2003, thanks to an aggressive marketing campaign that turned this regional Italian aperitivo into a worldwide phenomenon."

let carajilloNote = "The Zamora family began producing Licor 43, a sweet vanilla-based Spanish liqueur, in 1946. Its natural pairing with espresso created this popular cocktail, where proper shaking technique creates a signature foamy texture and balances the liqueur's sweetness with coffee's bitterness. While the drink's exact origins are unclear, it likely emerged from Spain."

let cosmoNote = "Born in the 1980s, the Cosmopolitan hit its stride in the early 2000s during the cocktail renaissance, with Dale DeGroff's Rainbow Room version leading the way. The HBO series 'Sex and the City' cemented its cultural status, transforming it from a craft cocktail into a modern classic."

let cornNOilNote = "The Corn 'n' Oil likely originated in 18th-century Barbados. Its name comes from Deuteronomy's reference to gathering 'corn, wine, and oil.' Like many cocktails of this era, its creator remains unknown."

let elDiabloNote = "The original 'Diablo' cocktail first appeared in the 1940 book 'The How and When' by Hayman Gale and Gerald F. Marco. Initially, it was a rum-based drink. Trader Vic later swapped the rum for tequila, initially calling it 'Mexican El Diablo' before shortening it to 'El Diablo'."

let hemingwayNote = "The Hemingway Daiquiri evolved from La Floridita's Daiquiri No. 3, one of the first blended daiquiris created by Constantino 'Constante' Ribalaigua using the then-novel blender. Hemingway requested his with no sugar and double rum, resulting in an intentionally tart and potent drink. While unconventional by modern balance standards, it represents a significant piece of cocktail history."

let palomaNote = "This combination of grapefruit soda and tequila originated in Mexico, known by various names across different regions. According to cocktail historian Dave Wondrich, it wasn't until the 1990s in California that it became known as the 'Paloma' (Spanish for 'dove'), after which the name stuck and spread worldwide."

let pimmsCupNote = "First bottled around 1912 as 'Pimm's No. 1 Cup,' this drink was an early predecessor to today's ready-to-drink cocktails, though without carbonation or citrus. Now the official drink of Wimbledon, modern Pimm's Cup recipes have evolved significantly, offering a more refined and refreshing experience than the original bottled formula. The base spirit, Pimm's, is a gin-based liqueur similar to an amaro."

let piscoSourNote = "The Pisco Sour is claimed as the national cocktail by both Peru and Chile. Its earliest version, served at Morris' bar in Peru, was simpler - containing neither egg whites nor bitters, as did early Chilean versions. While it reached the U.S. in the 1960s, it wasn't until the cocktail renaissance of the early 2000s that it evolved into today's classic egg white sour."

let rustyNailNote = "While Drambuie and Scotch have been mixed since Drambuie's debut in 1908, the name 'Rusty Nail' wasn't documented until 1961, according to cocktail historian Dave Wondrich. Like many classics of its era, the drink's specific creator remains unknown."

let singSlingNote = "Given the controversy surrounding the original recipe, we use the version claimed as authentic by the Raffles Hotel, the cocktail's birthplace."

let stingerNote = "The combination of brandy and crème de menthe appeared in New York in the late 1880s, though the name 'Stinger' wasn't attached until the early 1910s. While its classification as a true cocktail may be debatable, its historical significance merits inclusion."

let tomCollinsNote = "Originally known as the John Collins in the early 1800s, the name evolved through an unusual combination of circumstances: American bar patrons would prank visitors by claiming someone named 'Tom Collins' was badmouthing them at nearby bars. This prank, coupled with the drink's use of Old Tom Gin, led to today's name."

let vesperNote = "Despite common belief, this cocktail wasn't Fleming's creation but his friend Ivar Bryce's, as evidenced by Fleming's inscription: 'For Ivar, who mixed the first Vesper and said the good word.' The name came from Fleming's play on evening prayers ('Vespers'), referenced in Casino Royale as 'very appropriate to the violet hour.' Fleming later admitted finding the drink 'unpalatable' in a 1958 letter to The Guardian."

let whiskeySmashNote = "The 'Smash' began as a cocktail category in Jerry Thomas' 1862 book 'How to Mix Drinks,' typically featuring sugar, spirit, mint, and ice. This modern version adds fresh lemon juice, a modification popularized during the cocktail renaissance of the early 2000s, with Dale DeGroff's influence helping revive interest in this style."

let sherryCobblerNote = "Another cocktail whose origins are lost to time, this drink's recipe and preparation remain open to interpretation."

// History info mixed with and recipe info
let amarettoSourNote = "Introduced in 1974 by Amaretto di Saronno's importer, the original recipe called for 1.5 oz Amaretto to 3 oz sour mix. Our version relies on the liqueur's natural sweetness balanced with fresh lemon juice. When using egg white, we recommend 1 oz lemon juice; without egg white, try 0.75 oz lemon with 0.25 oz simple syrup, adjusting to taste."

let bizzyIzzyNote = "This is an interesting cocktail that seems to have a number of variations. The book with the original print calls for a pineapple syrup but the modern variation adds up to an ounce of pineapple juice. Though the book doesn't include soda in the recipe, it still labels the cocktail as a highball. It also doesn't mention any garnish. However, if you do add the sparkling water, add it last after you've shaken and strained the cocktail."

let bloodyMaryNote = "With multiple origin stories and no definitive creator, we present a classic version of this brunch staple. Consider it a template - adjust spicing and garnishes to your taste."

let margNote = "The Spanish word for 'daisy,' the Margarita follows the daisy cocktail formula - spirit, citrus, and liqueur instead of sugar. While its creator remains disputed, the classic recipe tends to lean toward the tart side. Add 0.25 oz agave or simple syrup if you prefer more balance."

let mintJulepNote = "One of the oldest documented cocktails, the Julep style dates to the early 1700s. This whiskey version gained prominence in the mid-1800s, though it didn't become the Kentucky Derby's signature drink until the 1930s. Our recipe offers a modern interpretation - adjust sweetness to taste."

let mojitoNote = "While the Mojito's Cuban origins trace to the 1800s and bars like La Floridita, this represents the modern interpretation found in craft cocktail bars. The original Cuban style was built in glass with the mint left in - both approaches yield a classic refresher."

let daiquiriNote = "This is the king of the Cuban cocktails. While the preferred balance of citrus and and sweet varies between bartenders, a high quality white rum is essential. We recommend Planteray 3 star or Banks 5 Island."

let darkAndStormyNote = "'The drink might have been invented by British sailors on shore leave in Bermuda after World War I. Though, in 1991, the Gosling family, which founded Gosling's in Bermuda in 1806, claimed a trademark for the recipe...' -David Wondrich, The Oxford Companion to Spirits and Cocktails"

let pinaColadaNote = "While 'Piña Colada' (strained pineapple) was originally a non-alcoholic Cuban refresher, the modern frozen/blended cocktail emerged with the creation of Coco Lopez in Puerto Rico. Now the island's official drink, it likely evolved naturally from adding rum to the original refresher. For this version, use about 250ml crushed ice when blending."

let robRoyNote = "Born from the Manhattan in the late 19th century, the Rob Roy simply swaps Scotch for American whiskey. The same era saw the Emerald, which uses Irish whiskey instead."

let sazeracNote = "Though originally Cognac-based, this modern interpretation with rye is our preferred version. Using rich demerara syrup adds texture and ensures full emulsification, unlike a sugar cube."

let ward8Note = "This recipe represents the earliest documented version that aligns with modern interpretations, despite competing origin stories. While orange juice or orange Curaçao is optional in several variations, it has become a common ingredient in contemporary versions. Given this modern throughline, we included it in our spec."

let whiskeySourNote = "The term 'Whiskey Sour' first appeared in print as early as 1826. Like the Old Fashioned, this classic cocktail has been a longstanding fixture in the world of mixology. Its origins are disputed, with numerous individuals claiming to have invented it over the years. While egg whites have always been an optional ingredient in the Whiskey Sour, their inclusion is recommended."

let martiniNote = "The Martini's evolution spans centuries. Originally vermouth-heavy, it progressed to equal parts, then gradually drier. Vodka began replacing gin in the 1910s, and by the 1950s, olive brine often substituted for reduced vermouth in vodka versions. While this recipe represents a classic preparation, the best Martini is the one made to your guest's preferences."

let prizeFighterNote = "Originally called simply 'Prizefighter' at Julie Reiner's Clover Club in Manhattan, the 'No. 1' was added after subsequent variations appeared on the menu."

let gibsonNote = "'The name came from illustrator Charles Dana Gibson, the creator of the Gibson Girl drawings, or Walter D.K. Gibson. Both were members of the club.' -Dave Wondrich, The Oxford Companion to Spirits and Cocktails"

let peguClubSavoyNote = "'One of the favorite cocktails at the Pegu Club, Burma. The one that has travelled, and is asked for, around the world.' -Harry Craddock"
